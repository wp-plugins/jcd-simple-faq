JCD Simple FAQ adds an FAQ custom post type, short code and widget.

== Description ==

Not everyone wants a fancy JQuery/Accordion FAQ system, so this simple plugin allows you to add as many questions and answers as you like and then display them straight on the page, via a short code, with minimal styling. Comes with 'Latest FAQ' widget.

== Installation ==

Upload the JCD Simple FAQ plugin to your blog and activate it.

You'll get a new main menu item in your Dashboard called 'FAQ'. Click here to add new items. Use the title for questions and the main body area for answers. You can in as much information as you like. 

To display your FAQ, simply add the [faq] short code to a page.

The plugin also comes with a sidebar widget you can use to display your most recent FAQ item. Simply drop the widget into a sidebar and give it a suitable title.

To make it easy for theme developers to style the output, questions have been given the class "question" and answers have been given the class "answer". The whole block has been wrapped in a div with the class "faq".

== Changelog ==

1.1 - Fixed incorrect closing h4 tag in widget.
1.1 - Removed featured image from FAQ post type
